[main]
# Plugin's main configuration section.

# Enable this package
#enabled = no

# The number of testing plugins running simultaneously
# * All the plugins will always be instantiated but only the specified number of
#   plugins will run their stress tests.
# * Value must be in range [1, 100]
#testers = 1


[tester]
# Default settings applied to every testers.
# These settings can be overridden on a per-tester basis by definining a new
# section [tester/<id>] where <id> is the 1-based ID of the tester (accepted
# <id> values are in the same range than the "testers" setting in the [main]
# section).

# It is possible to force disable a particular tester
# * Default is the 'enabled' value of the [main] section
# * This does not override the 'enabled' value of the [main] section in case it
#   is false
# * This does not override the 'testers' value of the [main] section
#enable = yes

# The number of catalog items this tester must insert/merge
# * Value must be in range [1, 1000000]
#catalog_size = 100000

# If this value is >0, the tester will commit the items to the catalog per
# batch instead of creating all items before committing them
#catalog_batch_size = 0

# Add some "salt" to the label and the description of catalog items to force the
# Catalog to update them upon merging. That is, the second time the tester will
# have to catalog its items.
# This is useful to simulate the worst conditions of merging, where all the
# items have to be updated.
#salt = no


[var]
# As in every Keypirinha's configuration file, you may optionally include a
# [var] section to declare variables that you want to reuse anywhere else in
# this file.
#
# Note that the [var] section is inherited, which means that any value defined
# in the main configuration file of the application (i.e.: "Keypirinha.ini") has
# already been made available to this file as well so you do not need to
# duplicate it here unless you want to override it.
#
# REMINDER: For convenience, Keypirinha silently populates this section with
# predefined values that may come handy. Here are some of them: APP_DIR,
# APP_EXE, PROFILE_DIR, PROFILE_DIR_INSTALLED_PACKS, PROFILE_DIR_LIVE_PACKS,
# PROFILE_DIR_USER and the KNOWNFOLDER_* and KNOWNFOLDERGUID_* values.
#
# See the "Configuration" chapter of the documentation for more information.


[env]
# For convenience, Keypirinha populates this [env] section in every loaded
# configuration file so you can easily access to environment variables like
# PATH for example from this file using syntax: ${env:PATH}
#
# If an environment variable happens to be changed while Keypirinha is running
# and this modification impacts current configuration, application and packages
# configuration will be reloaded if needed only.
#
# See the "Configuration" chapter of the documentation for more information.
